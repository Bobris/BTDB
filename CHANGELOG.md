## 26.1.0

### Added

ODbDump has new command `findsplitbrain` which can find first commit when content of relation in two instances of DB diverted - DBs needs to contain enough preserved history

## 26.0.0

### Fixed

Compactor sometimes removed unused files too late.

### Removed

`ReadOnlyListArrayWrapper` not used internally anymore and it is too confusing.

netcoreapp3.1 framework could be targeted again.

## 25.1.0

### Added

`LenientOpen` to `KeyValueDBOptions` (default false), in strict mode it does not try to recover as much as possible data, but starts with empty DB. When such problem is detected it will call new method `LogWarning` from `IKeyValueDBLogger`.
Also you can newly pass implementation of `IKeyValueDBLogger` into `Logger` field in `KeyValueDBOptions`.

## 25.0.1

### Fixed

Regression in SpanReader.CheckMagic which caused incomplete DB open in some cases.

Detect transaction leaks for writing transactions as well.

## 25.0.0

Failure to cast in FreeContent in ODBDictionary.

## 23.0.0

### Breaking changes

-   Visitor StartRelation gets whole info instead of just name of relation.
-   Public fields on Relation Rows and Database objects are forbidden unless they have `[NotStored]`. In next version they could became supported.

## 22.2.2

### Fixed

-   Final fix for IDictionaries

## 22.2.1

### Fixed

-   IDictionaries has uniqueness fix also for keys.
-   RelationInfo.GetProperties skips "NextInChain" IRelation property.

## 22.2.0

Important note: Don't forget to commit Transactions which calls GetRelation first time (auto registering them).

### Added

-   `ICovariantRelation<out T>` cannot have upsert, but it will implement `IRelation<T>` anyway.
-   removed class constraint because it created strange problems. It is now enforced in runtime.

### Fixed

-   IDictionaries now supports types with same name but different namespaces again.

## 22.1.0

### Added

-   `IsReadOnly()` on `IKeyValueDBTransaction` and used internally in auto registering Relations directly not just in writing transactions, but also in all non read only.

## 22.0.0

### BREAKING CHANGE

-   GetRelation(Type type) now returns IRelation type
-   RelationInfo public getters changed many types to ReadOnlyMemory.
-   Removed useless UniqueIndexAttribute

### Added

-   big chunk of IL generated code for Relations and ODBDictionary/Set is now cached forever, making it faster to instantiate Relations repeatedly. It adds new limitation that instances of `ITypeConvertorGenerator` and `IFieldHandlerFactory` needs to be same over process runtime.

## 21.0.0

### BREAKING CHANGE

-   Relations interfaces needs to be inherited from `IRelation<T>`

### Added

-   `IRelation<T>` and `IRelation` interfaces. You will get `Upsert` method for free.

```C#
    public interface IRelation<T> : IReadOnlyCollection<T>, IRelation where T : class
    {
        bool Upsert(T item);
    }

    public interface IRelation
    {
        Type BtdbInternalGetRelationInterfaceType();
        IRelation? BtdbInternalNextInChain { get; set; }
    }
```

-   `IObjectDbTransaction` has new methods

```C#
    object GetRelation(Type type);

    T GetRelation<T>() where T : class, IRelation
    {
        return (T)GetRelation(typeof(T));
    }
```

These lazily creates instance of relation for current transaction. If it is for first time it will also create it (in current transaction if it is writable, or in new writable transaction). It automatically names relation by `T.ToSimpleName()` or uses `PersistentName` attribute on `T`.

You can register your own custom relation factory by using `void IObjectDB.RegisterCustomRelation(Type type, Func<IObjectDBTransaction, object> factory);`.

You can forbid automatic registration of relations by `IObjectDB.AllowAutoRegistrationOfRelations = false`. Good in production code to allow auto registration only during initial transaction.

### Fixed

-   regression in 20.x in compatibility of Enums in relations with `BinaryCompatibilityOnly` attribute.

## 20.3.0

### Added

-   ReadOnly option to opening DB. ODbDump using it and allows to pass ulongcommit as third parameter to open DB in historical moment.

### Fixed

-   Mixing Lists, Sets and Arrays in EventLayers

## 20.2.0

### Added

-   IOC now support `Dependency` attribute for properties injection. Also it could be used for renaming dependency resolved name. Nullable reference types are optional dependencies.

## 20.1.0

### Added

-   IOC now supports public properties injection. Registration needs to be done with `PropertiesAutowired()`. Setters does not need to be public. Nullable reference types are optional dependencies, all other properties are required.

## 20.0.0

### Added

-   Added support for `IOrderedSet<T>` lazily stored set.
-   EventLayers deserialization can now unwrap `IIndirect<T>`, making it compatible change (`IIndirect<T>` => `T`, or `IDictionary<TKey, IIndirect<T>>` => `IDictionary<TKey, T>`).
-   New documentation for [supported types](Doc/SupportedTypes.md)
-   Added support for `ISet<T>`, `HashSet<T>` with identical serialization as `IList<T>`.
-   Removed some allocations from `IOrderedDictionary`

## 19.8.0

### Added

-   Relations now support returning only partial classes. For example it allows to speed up table scanning because you can deserialize only fields you need when enumerating relation.

## 19.7.1

### Fixed

-   Made AesGcmSymmetricCipher thread safe.

## 19.7.0

### Added

-   Support `EncryptedString` in DB indexes (orderable).

## 19.6.0

### Added

-   New `EncryptedString` type to be able to store string in its encrypted form. You need to pass `ISymmetricCipher` implementation to `DBOptions`, `TypeSerializersOptions`, `EventSerializer` and `EventDeserializer`. There is class `AesGcmSymmetricCipher` implementing `ISymmetricCipher`, which provides perfect security by just passing 32 bytes key to its constructor.

## 19.5.0

-   Added possibility to deserialize event with Nullable to dynamic (usable for dumping EventStore)

## 19.4.0

### Added

-   All serializations DB, Event now supports `System.Version` type. Default conversion allows to upgrade from `string` to `Version`. When `Version` is used in ordering, keys it behaves as expected.

### Fixed

## 19.3.0

### Added

Relations new methods `AnyById` and `AnyBy{SecKeyName}` supported.

## 19.2.0

    <LangVersion>8</LangVersion>
    <Nullable>annotations</Nullable>

`StructList.Add()` renamed to `AddRef()`.
