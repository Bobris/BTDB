In first phase of this project this should be Key Value store written in C# without using any native code.
It has ACID properties with MVCC. It is easily embedable. One storage is just one file/stream.
At one time there could be multiple read only transactions and one write transaction.
Because it reuses deallocated space, it does not need compaction (or atleast not that often).

Limits:
Maximum Key length is limited by 31bits (2GB). Best performance has keys with length smaller than 524 bytes.
Maximum value length is limited by 63bits (8EB = 8 Exa Bytes).
Total pairs count is limited by 63bits.
Total size of database file is limited by 63bits (8EB).

These limits are in design, currently project is not that far that these could be tested, I don't have such huge disk :-).

Please is you find it usefull or have questions, write me e-mail (boris.letocha@gmail.com) so I know that it is used.

I am still finetuning speed. Transaction Log for better speed is currently not implemented.
