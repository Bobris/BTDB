In first phase of this project this should be Key Value store written in C# without using any native code.
It has ACID properties. Is easily embedable. One storage is just one file/stream.
At one time there could be multiple read only transactions and one write transaction.

Limits:
Maximum Key length is limited by 31bits (2GB)
Maximum value length is limited by 63bits (8EB = 8 Exa Bytes).
Total pairs count is limited by 63bits.
Total size of database file is limited by 63bits (8EB).

These limits are in design, currently project is not that far that these could be tested.
